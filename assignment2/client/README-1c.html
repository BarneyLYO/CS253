<h3>Image Crawler Parallel Stream Client App (Assignment 1b)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java's functional programming features and their integration with
Java's parallel streams and Spring WebMVC.  In particular, in this
assignment you'll develop an app that uses several Java parallel
streams strategies to obtain, transform, and store images.</p>

<p> Like the first part of this assignment, the code you'll write here
has a GUI and runs as an Android client app that can either

<UL>

<LI> Perform all image processing locally on the client device running
Android or <P>

<LI> Perform all the image processing remotely using a microservice
that can be deployed on one or more servers and implemented via Spring
WebMVC.
</uL>

Please use this GUI along with the unit tests discussed below to help
evaluate and debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>Detailed overviews of the Java parallel streams framework are
available in <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6ca8KCAjj3HaworY-mqmCe>this</A>
YouTube playlist.  Naturally, we'll cover this material in class,
which will be available in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A
HREF="://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4uV6IgyjGNH9U-Tx-9c4LN">here</A>.</li>
<p>

<li> The book <A
HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-java-in-action">Modern Java
in Action</A> is a great resource to learn how to program Java
streams. </li> </ul>

<HR width=50% align=left> <h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 1b you'll
need to do the following: </p>

<ul>

<li> Complete your implementation of <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment1a/">assignment
2a</a>, taking into account my review comments since it forms the
basis for the client app in this assignment.  Please come to office
hours or post questions on Piazza if you have any remaining questions
about your assignment 1a solution. </li>

</ul>

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using Android Studio.
This app is written in both Kotlin and Java and demonstrates
<EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the purposes of Assignment
1b, however, you only need to be aware of the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and
are used to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests">app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests</A>,
which is an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 29, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 29 (I recommend API 30). If you don't already have an Android
Emulator you can create one by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"></A> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<p> In this part of the assignment you'll start by completing the
implementation of an image crawler class in the
<CODE>ParallelStreamsCrawler.java</CODE> file in the
<CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</CODE>
folder.  This class applies a couple of minuscule tweaks to
<CODE>SequentialStreamsCrawler</CODE> class so that Java parallel
streams are used to perform an "image crawl" starting from a root Uri
to obtain, transform, and store images.  Depending on the parameters
used to run the tests, images from HTML pages reachable from the root
Uri are either downloaded from a remote web server or read from the
local file system and the results are stored in files. </p>

<p> Also in this part of the assignment you'll complete the
implementation of an image crawler class in the
<CODE>ParallelStreamsCrawler2.java</CODE> file in the
<CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</CODE>
folder.  This classes use a more advanced Java parallel stream
implementation to perform an "image crawl" starting from a root Uri to
obtain, transform, and store images. </p>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
Your should convert your <CODE>SequentialStreamsCrawler</CODE> class
from <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment1a/">
assignment 1a</A> to the <CODE>ParallelStreamsCrawler</CODE> class in
assignment 1b by making minuscule changes to use Java parallel
streams.  </p>

You must also complete the collector implementation in the
<CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArrayCollector.java</CODE>
file.  Graduate students should implement a concurrent collector using
the
<CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/SynchronizedArray</CODE>
class implementation from the last assignment in their
<CODE>ArrayCollector.java</CODE> implementation. Undergraduate
students can ignore the <CODE>SynchronizedArray</CODE> class and
implement a non-concurrent collector by using their
<CODE>UnsynchronizedArray</CODE> class.<P>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or (unnecessary)
conditional statements in this assignment and instead use Java
parallel stream operations and functional programming features.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment2b">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> The unit tests in the
<code>image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler</code>
folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to
use the Android Studio GUI to run the unit tests locally on your
computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 2b is designed to deepen your experience developing
apps using Java functional programming features and Java parallel
streams without the need to program the fork-join thread pool
directly.  The skeletons and unit tests are extensive, though you
don't need to understand them all to complete your solution.  Please
start early and ask questions in class, office hours, and on the
Piazza discussion forum. </p>
